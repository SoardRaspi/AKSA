<h1>AKSA: Apghat Kshetra Suchak App</h1>

<h3>This app is an attempt to alert the user when the user is enterring an accident-prone area so that the user takes extra care while travelling in that area. The word 'Aksa' means soul, and quite appropriately suited for the purpose it serves; an attempt at saving lives.</h3>
